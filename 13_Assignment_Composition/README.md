ðŸš— Car & Engine Composition in Python
This project demonstrates the concept of composition in Object-Oriented Programming using Python. We define two classes: Engine and Car. The Car class uses composition by including an Engine object and accessing its method.

ðŸ§± Classes
Engine: Contains a method start() which returns a string indicating the engine has started.

Car: Accepts an Engine object during initialization and uses it to start the engine via its start_car() method.
