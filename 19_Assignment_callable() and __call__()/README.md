# Multiplier Class

This project contains a Python class called `Multiplier`, which allows you to multiply an input value by a predefined factor. The class demonstrates the use of special methods `__init__()` and `__call__()` to make the class instances callable like functions.

## Features
- The class is initialized with a factor value.
- You can multiply any input by this factor by calling the object directly.
- The `__call__()` method is used to make the object callable like a function.

## Usage

1. **Initialization**: 
   You create an instance of the `Multiplier` class by passing the multiplier factor to the constructor.

2. **Calling the Object**: 
   Once the instance is created, you can call it like a function, passing the value you want to multiply by the factor.

### Example

```python
# Creating a Multiplier instance with a factor of 5
multiplier = Multiplier(5)

# Checking if the object is callable
print(callable(multiplier))  # Output: True

# Calling the object with a value to
