# Access Modifiers in Python: Public, Protected, and Private

This project demonstrates how access modifiers work in Python using a simple `Employee` class.

## 👩‍💼 Class: Employee

The class has three types of variables:

- `name`: Public variable – can be accessed from anywhere.
- `_salary`: Protected variable – should be accessed only within the class or its subclasses.
- `__ssn`: Private variable – cannot be accessed directly from outside the class due to name mangling.
