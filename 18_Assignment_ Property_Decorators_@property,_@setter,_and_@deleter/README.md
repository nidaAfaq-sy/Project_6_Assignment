Product Class with Property Decorators
This project demonstrates the use of Python's @property, @setter, and @deleter decorators to manage a product's price in a class. The Product class has a private attribute _price, and the decorators provide controlled access to this attribute.

Features
Getter (@property): Retrieves the price of the product.

Setter (@price.setter): Allows updating the price, with a check to ensure the price is not negative.

Deleter (@price.deleter): Deletes the price attribute.
